                <p>
                    The earliest known version of Sudoku can be traced back to Latin square puzzles, which were developed by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. These puzzles involved placing numbers in a grid so that each row and column contained all of the numbers from 1 to n, where n is the size of the grid.
